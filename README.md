# SDVXPAD

## Introduction

THIS PROJECT IS MODIFIED FROM [brokenithm-kb](https://github.com/4yn/brokenithm-kb)

Brokenithm-kb is very convenient for those who want to use iPad to play SUSPlayer without boring and tedious ipa installation process.

The same is true for someone want to use iPad as SDVX controller.

So I made this project named SDVXPAD.

We can use SDVXPAD to let your iPad, mobile phone or any other touchable device with a browser be able to serve as SDVX controller.I really like the convenience of web controller though it may have some performance limit due to network communication.

## Feature

Brokenithm-kb uses API SendInput from user32.dll to simulate keyboard input. Unlike Brokenithm-kb, SDVXPAD uses [DD.dll](https://github.com/ddxoft/master) to solve the issue that Brokenithm-kb's input cannot be received by some applications. In theory, SDVXPAD can also be extended to be the controller of other games.

## Setup

The setup process is the same as Brokenithm-kb so if you have any problem you can refer to [this](https://github.com/4yn/brokenithm-kb)
